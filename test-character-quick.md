Name: Kaelen
Race: Wood Elf
Profession: Retired Royal Guard / Tavern Keeper

Voice: Speaks in short, gruff sentences. Avoids pleasantries and formal language. Uses "hmmph" and "bah" as common expressions. Refers to people as "traveler" or "stranger" until he knows them.
Backstory: Kaelen was once a proud member of the Royal Guard of Eldermere, serving for over 150 years. During the Great War against the Shadow Legion, he lost his left leg below the knee in a brutal battle defending the city gates. The injury was caused by dark magic, which left him permanently distrustful of all magical practices. After his retirement, he inherited The Rusty Tankard from his father, a small tavern on the outskirts of the city. He keeps a three-legged cat named "Stumpy" as a companion and has a secret garden behind the tavern where he grows herbs and vegetables. Despite his gruff exterior, he's known to give free meals to travelers who are down on their luck, though he'll grumble about it the whole time.
